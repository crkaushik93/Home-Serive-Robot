# Home-Service-Robot---RSEND---Project-5

Interfaced essential ROS packages such as Navigation using the Slam_gmapping package and extimating the pose of the Robot using the EKF package  to localise a robot in a simulation environment

ROS Navigation stack, which is based on the Dijkstra's, a variant of the Uniform Cost Search algorithm, to plan our robot trajectory from start to goal position. 

The ROS navigation stack permits the robot to avoid any obstacle on its path by re-planning a new trajectory once your robot encounters them.

Examined the AMCL algorithm to familiarise with the navigation stack for localisation purposes. 

Utilised EKF algorithms in localising a robot to estimate the position of the robot. 

Coded ROS nodes in C++ for making the robot navigate autonomoulsy.

Developed a pick and place algorithm to enable the robot move to the position of the object and pick it and place it to the required goal. 

Build the Catkin space and edited the CMake files to process whole simulation in th GAzebo environment.
